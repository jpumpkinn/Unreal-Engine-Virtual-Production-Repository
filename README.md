# Unreal-Engine-Virtual-Production-Repository

I'm posting and sharing my Virtual Production UE4 scene for anyone to get started with. 
I had a hard time finding a complete working scene that offered control of the the Vive tracker 
and cine camera at the same time. This is pieced together from blue prints I found online then tweaked. 
This scene uses 1 Vive Tracker 1 Basestation and a Xbox Gamepad to control the camera movement. 
The Vive tracker will allow you to move the virtual cine camera around with your practical rig. 
The Xbox Gamepad will control faster longer moves in very slow .01 increments from .01 to 3 numerical range. 
It can easily be adjusted in the Blue prints variables. You do have to set the Vive Tracker binding to "Special 1". 
Also, you do have to mouse click into the preview screen for the Gamepad functions to work. 
Also, the camera increments are .01 by default so you will have to use the top shoulder buttons to change 
the increments. If you can improve on this please share the file.
UPDATE: Version 2 is here. Added ability to cycle through lenses by hitting the Y button on the xbox gamepad, 
Auto focus by hitting the A Button and briefly shows what lens your using on screen. You can also change the 
lenses to the lenses you want by selecting the Camera-Controller-Rate pawn go to the Details panel under Default 
you can enter your own lens info.
